The *.csf files are examples of session files.

WARNING: It is not recommended to play these sessions files with Commander-4
because they have been edited manually to demonstrate/test the capabilities 
of the SessionAnalyser script.

Each zip file contains a csf file and the files (html + png) generated by SessionAnalyser.

 - Download a zip file
 - Extract the 3 files (csf, html and png) in the same directory
 - Open the html file in your browser.
